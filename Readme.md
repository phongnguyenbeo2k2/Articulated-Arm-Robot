Project design articulated arm robot on Matlab from scratch, which don't use robot toolbox.
Robot is inspire from GP7 robot yaskawa.
In this project, robot can:
- Do forward kinematics of position. 
- Do inverse kinematic of position.
- Calculate the velocity of robot in the 3D space from velocity of each joint based on Jacobian matrix.
- Trapezoidal trajectory planning.
- Can raw workspace of robot.
